I'm a README file.  Installation instructions to come :)











How to use these files to calculate a phase profile:

1) Generate a target using Targets.ipynb
	A few examples are given. 512x512 target arrays are created and saved into initialisation/targetname/
2) Decide on the initialisation: signal/noise regions/ weighting arrays etc using Regions.ipynb
	These will (most likely!) be based on the target: load the appropriate target; define regions based on this; save in initialisation/targetname/regionname/ 



Hopefully this way all the data should stay organised! This will be done firstly by target, then initialisation parameters (of which you'll probably want to try a variety for each target), then by cost function and minimisation process used. 





Notes:



Things to do:
	Currently using uniform laser profile - build Gaussian into calculations. The beam profile shouldn't change much (found previously that although vortices were far less of a problem with a very small beam, this wasn't really worth it in terms of loss of useful pixels and corresponding flexibility) so could just include this in phase_calculation.ipynb, or could have as a data file to be loaded each time.
